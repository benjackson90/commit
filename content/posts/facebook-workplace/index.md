## Workplace for Good: Coordinate and communicate with staff during emergencies
We know that across the world, non-profit organizations and NGOs are helping with crisis management, coordinating volunteers, and much more. To help non-profits around the world better prepare for unforeseen emergencies, we provide free access to Workplace through our [Workplace for Good](https://www.facebook.com/workplace/workplaceforgood#) program, allowing organizations to connect teams and coordinate communication among remote workers or on-the-ground volunteers.

“Thanks to Workplace, we are able to deliver real-time, essential updates to our staff on the Covid-19 outbreak,” says Carey Kyer, Lead – Internal Communications at World Health Organization (WHO). “Workplace ‘ticks the box’ on our need to communicate, engage and connect real-time with our colleagues around the world, especially during this public health emergency of international concern."

“Our Covid-19 Workplace group is the second most-followed group at WHO. It’s become an easy-to-access channel for our staff around the world to watch the daily press briefings, staff seminars and to find resources, while providing an open forum for staff to ask questions and receive instant feedback.”

Our sympathies go out to all those affected by this outbreak around the world. We hope our technology will be able to help in preventing more people from being exposed to the virus and have an impact on this worldwide crisis.
