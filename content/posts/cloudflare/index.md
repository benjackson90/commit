The outbreak of COVID-19 (coronavirus) is forcing teams to change where and how they work. That shift disproportionately impacts small businesses with smaller IT teams.
Cloudflare protects and accelerates more than 26 million Internet properties today. Cloudflare for Teams helps some of the world’s largest organizations stay productive from any location. We’re making those enterprise-grade features available to small businesses at no cost.*

Here's how we're helping small businesses:

- Cloudflare is offering free seats of Cloudflare for Teams for small businesses through September 1. There is no commitment to continue using the product after September 1.
- The program includes an optional 30-minute onboarding session with a technical expert.
- If you are interested, please complete this form. We’ll send instructions to get you started with Teams.
