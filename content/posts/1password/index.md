Over the past few weeks, we’ve seen some unprecedented and frightening changes around the world as a result of COVID-19. We’ve watched as events are canceled, travel becomes restricted, and towns (and even countries) go into lockdown.

In an effort to slow the spread of coronavirus and protect the vulnerable, an increasing number of companies — including Google, Twitter, Shopify and more — are asking their employees to work from home. Here at 1Password, we’re a largely remote company by nature, but even we have implemented steps to slow the spread of the virus by closing our meeting spaces and eliminating business travel.

These are important steps we should all take to protect our teams and loved ones.

## Tips to make remote work, work
We’re big proponents of remote work, but adjusting to it can be a challenge, especially when the decision to close offices is made quickly.

We’ve learned a lot about working remotely over the past 14 years, and have shared some of our top tips to help those struggling to do so effectively.

The hardest part of working remotely is doing so securely. We built 1Password Business to help you do exactly that.

## Helping where we can
We’re removing the 30-day trial period on 1Password Business so companies can start keeping their teams secure without getting finance involved.

[Sign up for 1Password Business](https://1password.com/business/) today and get your first 6 months free.

## Stay safe
It’s difficult to predict what the next few weeks will look like, but we need to work together to protect our teams, loved ones, and local communities. Reduce unnecessary travel — including travel to and from the office — and be empathetic to the challenges that remote work can bring to your teams and their families. Staying safe is a team effort. ❤️
