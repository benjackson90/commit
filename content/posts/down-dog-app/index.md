Due to the current outbreak, many people are avoiding gathering in large groups, including at yoga studios and other fitness spaces. We believe that stressful times like these are precisely when people need wellness practices the most, and we are committed to doing our part to help out.

So that anyone who wants to practice at home can do so, we are making all of our apps - Down Dog, Yoga for Beginners, HIIT, Barre, and 7 Minute Workout - **completely free until May 1st.**

In response to the many school closures taking place, we are also offering **free access until July 1st for all students and teachers** (K-12 and college). To access the free school membership, please register your school's domain by visiting [downdogapp.com/schools](https://www.downdogapp.com/schools).

We are also extending free access until July 1 for all **healthcare professionals** so we can help those who are helping us. Please visit [downdogapp.com/healthcare](https://www.downdogapp.com/healthcare) to register your work healthcare domain.

We hope that everyone will stay healthy and safe in these uncertain times.

With love,
The Down Dog Team
