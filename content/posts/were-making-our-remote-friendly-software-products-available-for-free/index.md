### Starting today, small teams can use Atlassian Cloud products at no charge, in addition to our existing free offerings for teams of all sizes.

At Atlassian, we believe that all organisations deserve access to best-in-class tools that unleash their teams’ potential. That’s why we’re excited to announce that starting this week, our flagship cloud products are now available for free to teams of up to ten people. This is not a time-bound offer. Rather, it’s our full commitment to make our products more easily accessible to more teams throughout the world, full stop.

Starting today, teams can get cloud-based editions of Jira Software, Confluence, Jira Service Desk, and Jira Core at no charge. This adds to the existing free offerings already in place for Trello, Bitbucket, and Opsgenie, which give all types of teams a set of great capabilities for collaboration. These products can be accessed starting today at [www.atlassian.com/free](https://www.atlassian.com/software/free).
