In our seven years, many teachers reached out to us about how they can use tools more efficiently so they can spend more time educating. We want to continue to be a key element in your computer science programs. With your feedback, the GitHub Education team is excited to release the latest features to help teachers bring industry-standard tools into their classrooms.

Now, teachers can use GitHub Classroom with autograding to save time by automating parts of the grading process. Your students benefit from earlier feedback to reinforce or start to correct their studies. And we’re also launching Teacher Toolbox to provide the industry’s best tools to teachers at no cost, including popular services like Arduino and Name.com

Try autograding in [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/) and take advantage of the offers from the new [GitHub Teacher Toolbox.](https://education.github.com/teachers)
